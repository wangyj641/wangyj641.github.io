## My Hometown
I was born and raised in a rural coutry in the middle of China. My family always struggled with poverty. My childhood is very tough.

I lived in this farmer house from 7 years old to university. It is a 2-storey farmer house. There is a small garden in the front of house, where My parents growed many vegertables. I like this garden.
